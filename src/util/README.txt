These files are originally from free Delphi components, due to some compatibily issues with Lazarus I'm just using these files instead the entire component.

KAZip.pas is from KAZip 2.0 component made by Kiril Antonov, it is available at http://kadao.dir.bg.

unitPEFile.pas and unitResourceDetails.pas are from "Resource Utilities" made by Collin Wilson, author of the famous XN Resource Editor. Its website (http://www.wilsonc.demon.co.uk/delphi.htm) doesn't exists anymore but is possible to find the complete package in archive.org.

There is a zipped copy of the two entire packages on this directory.
